There are two versions because running the Python version on [replit](https://replit.com/) was unreliable. Sometimes it would work and sometimes it wouldn't without any rhyme or reason. It uses Pygame and I replit support for Pygame projects is limited.

So I built the JavaScript version as a way to distribute the project over the Internet.

The Python version works on it's own without a browser and can be used by people with some technical skills that know how to run a program.
